**Tip for more accurate results:**
- As older news tends to get deprioritized by sources, trying recent news may yield better results       
- Try news claims as they appear in the sources
- For claims older than 36 hours, consider rephrasing the claim by removing time-sensitive words like "recently," "today," "now," etc.
- Rephrase verbs from present tense to past tense for older events. Examples below:
  - Instead of "launches/unveils/releases" ‚Üí use "has launched/unveiled/released"
  - Instead of "announces/invites/retaliates/ends" ‚Üí use "has announced/invited/retaliated/ended"
